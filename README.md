# 303CodeTest

This project displays a list obtained from a remote resource. It is written in Swift and is very simple.

Things to consider when augmenting this project:

* Unit tests!
* Client support for pagination (API appears to have support for this)
* Make UI prettier
* Make UI have ability to refresh, detecting whether data has changed and only then refresh the screen
* Make API more robust with regards to whatever API supports
* Nice app icon
* List caching in case of no-network situation
* List sorting (by name, city)
* List search
